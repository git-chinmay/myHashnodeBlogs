# Conversation with ChatGPT

I am sure almost everyone at least once came across a chatbot in last few years. Whether its a bank website or any travel agency customer site, now days everyone start implementing chatbots to help the customer queries instantly. Today we will discuss about a powerful Chatbot called ChatGPT but before that lets understand from the basic what is a chatbot?


### What is a chatbot?

At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be as simple as rudimentary programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.

Let's have a basic discussion on a such chatbot model developed by OpenAI called ChatGPT.


### What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a new AI bot in town. It is an AI chatbot system that OpenAI released in November to show off and test what a very large, powerful AI system can accomplish. The bot lets you type questions using natural language that the chatbot answers in conversational, if somewhat stilted, language. The bot remembers the thread of your dialog, using previous questions and answers to inform its next responses.

For example, you can ask it encyclopedia questions like, "Explaining Newton's laws of motion." You can tell it, "Write me a poem," and when it does, say, "Now make it more exciting." You ask it to write a computer program that'll show you all the different ways you can arrange the letters of a word.


### What kinds of questions can you ask?

You can ask anything, though you might not get an answer. OpenAI suggests a few categories, like explaining physics, asking for birthday party ideas and getting programming help.

I asked it to write a story with certain keywords and it did. I asked it few philosophical questions and it produced pretty good answers.


### Who built the ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is the brainchild of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research company. It's made splashes before, first with GPT-3, which can generate text that can sound like a human wrote it, and then DALL-E, which creates what's now called "generative art" based on text prompts you type in. ChatGPT is based on the GPT3.5 and its a large language model.

### What are the limits of ChatGPT?

ChatGPT sometimes can give you wrong answers and also few times it will notify you its shortcomings by saying these line *“I'm sorry, but I am not able to browse the internet or access any external information beyond what I was trained on.”*

**What is humanity?**

*Humanity is the human race, which includes all people. It is often used to refer to the qualities that make us human, such as compassion, empathy, and the ability to love and care for others. It can also refer to the condition of being human, including the strengths and weaknesses that are unique to us as a species.*

Asked the same question again and answer framing was slightly different

*Humanity is the quality of being human, which encompasses a wide range of characteristics and behaviors including the ability to reason, to communicate, to love, and to experience a range of emotions. It is the characteristic that distinguishes people from other animals and enables us to form complex societies and cultures.*

Similarly on question on Moor’s law it gives two answers. One pointed optimistically to continued progress, while the other pointed more grimly to the slowdown and the belief "that Moore's Law may be reaching its limits." 

Both ideas are common in the computer industry itself. The fact that it offers an answer at all, though, is a notable development in computing unlike other computers who refuses to answer at all if you dont follow certain syntax and notations.


### How Can I access ChatGPT?

For now its free for public use but may be in future it will be monetised like DALL-E.

To play with this you just have to Login to the site https://chat.openai.com/chat

If you want to use it in your code for developing some POC or just for fun, we can do it easily. I did some testing with python script and it was fun. I am sharing some answer's it generated

### Conclusion

There has been a great progress in the field of NLP and it starts with the development of transformer model. It can be creative, and its answers can sound downright authoritative but we should not blindly trust its raw output without any validation because unlike Google search it does not give us any link from where it took answers. There is no doubt ChatGPT is powerful and knowledgeable but for now i think it just a cool toy until we have found few use cases that will change the humanity in a positive way.
